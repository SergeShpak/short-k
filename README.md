# Shortik: Simple URL Shortener service

This repository contains code of a simple URL Shortener service.

# Development

This section contains information on the service development. Everything should run smoothly on a Linux AMD64 machine.

## Prerequisites

You should install the following tools locally to simplify the service development:

- `go` >= 1.22: https://go.dev/doc/install
- `docker`: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- `lefthook`: a tool to manage git hooks, https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook?tab=readme-ov-file#install

You should run `lefthook` install after fetching the repository for the first time: it will configure the required git hooks.
